# Project 4 - Trivia App

Submitted by: Aishwarya Roy

Trivia is an app that offers users an engaging way to test their knowledge across a variety of topics through a series of multiple-choice and 
true/false questions sourced from the Open Trivia Database API. Users can answer a set of questions, view their score at the end, and restart
